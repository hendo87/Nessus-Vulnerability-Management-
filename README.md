# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management-

<i>In this lab I run a credentialed scan on a outdated Windows vm with vulnerabilities. I identify, classify, prioritize, remediate and mitigate the software vulnerabilites. Vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security.</i>


## Credentialed scan for Windows host not on our domain

<i>We need to allow our scanner to connect to this hosts registry and look for insecure configurations</i>

# Vulnerablities
<i>As you can see , after running the credentialed scan we have many critical and high vulnerabilites on our host. Lets dive into them and begin remediating the vulnerabilites</i>

<li>From reading the description we can see that the Firefox browser is outdated. Outdated web browsers can create significant vulnerabilities in a system because they may lack crucial security patches, fail to support modern security practices, and be incompatible with contemporary web standards. Keeping browsers up to date is essential to mitigate these risks and protect against potential threats. We can either uninstall or choose to update the browser</li>

<i>Our next vulnerability is SMB signing. It looks like the signiture is not required on the SMB server. SMB signing (Server Message Block signing) is a security feature used to protect the integrity of data transmitted over the SMB protocol, which is commonly used for file sharing and network communication in Windows environments. When SMB signing is enabled, each SMB packet (message) sent over the network includes a cryptographic signature this validates the integrity of the data and verifies the identity of the sender, making it much harder for an attacker to successfully tamper with or intercept SMB communications.</i>
